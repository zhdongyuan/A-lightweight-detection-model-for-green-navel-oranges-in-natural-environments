## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for your interest in and support of my research. To promote academic exchange and cooperation, we are providing Dataset 2 of green navel oranges in the TXT format. If you would like to expand the dataset, you can use [Imgaug for segmentation maps and masks](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/examples_segmentation_maps.html) to perform image augmentation. These datasets have been carefully organized and cleaned to provide valuable research resources for researchers in related fields.

## Dataset Content:
- Data Source: The dataset is sourced from the internet and covers various types of citrus fruits, including oranges, grapefruits, navel oranges, and lemons.
- Data Format: The data annotations are provided in TXT format, and the structure and content of each file are described in detail below.
